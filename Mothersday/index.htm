        <p>
          Mi amor, on this special day, while we celebrate the incredible mother
          you are, I also want to celebrate you. Thank you for being my partner,
          my best friend, my inspiration, the only one who makes me laugh beyond
          my serious faces, and for being the love of my life. Our journey
          together is my greatest treasure, and our beautiful family is the
          meaning in my life.

        <p>
          Watching you love our baby fills my heart with joy. Your patience,
          your endless energy, the way you listen, teach, and love her
          unconditionally ‚Äì it's truly impeccable. You sacrifice so much and
          give so freely, shaping her life in the most beautiful ways. Thank you
          for being the amazing mother you are with your chichi will never need
          anyone to fill her heart with love because you are her everything.

        <h2>I First Loved you as mom...</h2>
        <div class="poem">
          <p>
            I always loved you, perhaps, from a distance,<br />
            Before we met, before today.<br />
            But a brand new kind of love took flight,<br />
            The moment you you loved our baby and held her so tight.<br />
            Seeing and hearing you step into that role,<br />
            Captured completely, my heart and soul.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through sleepless nights and gentle feeds,<br />
            You sowed the most devoted seeds.<br />
            Each whispered word, each soft caress,<br />
            A mother's pure, true tenderness.<br />
            The patience you showed, the love you gave,<br />
            A beautiful spirit, strong and brave.
          </p>

          <p>
            I watched you learn, adapt, and grow,<br />
            With strength you didn't even know.<br />
            Juggling needs with effortless grace,<br />
            Putting smiles upon each little face.<br />
            Your dedication, clear and deep,<br />
            Promises only a mother can keep.
          </p>

          <p>
            And seeing you in that soft, warm light,<br />
            Made my own love burn more bright.<br />
            Sharing this journey, side by side,<br />
            With you, my partner, and my guide.<br />
            The bond of parents, true and strong,<br />
            Is where my deepest feelings belong.
          </p>

          <p>
            So yes, I loved you then, first as Mom,<br />
            A quiet awe, a sudden calm.<br />
            And that first love, now deeper grown,<br />
            Is still the sweetest I have known.<br />
            Happy Mother's Day, mi amor,<br />
            You are the greatest part of our lives.
